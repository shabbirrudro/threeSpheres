# Project Title: Interactive Spheres Experience

## Description
This Unity project showcases an interactive 3D experience where users can interact with three spheres which are rotating around each other. After starting from the starting screen, upon clicking any sphere, the camera smoothly zooms in on the selected sphere, transitioning to another scene which gives more information on the selected sphere, with a restart button on screen to start the scenes again. This project demonstrates advanced Unity features such as camera control, object interactions, and scene transitions.

## Features
- **Camera Movement**: Users can navigate the scene using mouse and keyboard inputs to move and look around.
- **Interactive Spheres**: Clicking on a sphere triggers a zoom-in effect.
- **Scene Transitions**: After zooming in, the scene transitions to another scene and shows more information about the selected sphere.
- **Restarting the Experience**: The user can restart the experience again from the third scene.
